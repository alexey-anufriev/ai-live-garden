# Autonomous Experiment Verdict

This verdict evaluates the safe code committed by the previous autonomous run. Shadow evaluation is evidence for the next iteration, not a merge gate. The next agent must inspect the current implementation and explicitly choose to keep, revise, or revert it.

- Classification: `inert`
- Acceptance: `experiment`
- PM direction: `A`
- Metric: `population.BEETLE`
- Goal: `increase`
- Required delta: 10
- Observed delta: 0
- Baseline average: 2
- Candidate average: 2
- Safety passed: true
- Target passed: false

## Implemented Hypothesis

Relaxed reproduction constraints (stressed/starving check bypass) in `OrganismInteractionCalculator` for low-density beetle populations.

## Harness Conclusion

The code was safe but produced zero measured effect. Inspect the committed implementation, identify the inactive gate or clamp, and revise or revert it in the next run; do not add another disconnected mechanism.

## Required Next Decision

Set `causalReach.previousFeedbackDecision` to `reuse`, `revise`, or `abandon` and explain the decision with current-state evidence. Because this code is already on main, inspect and change the implementation directly; there is no rejected branch to recover.


## Harness Finalization

The accepted source and measured verdict were preserved, but the garden tick and generated-memory transaction were rolled back because: accepted-finalization=success; AUTO_MEMORY_OUTCOME=failure,SYNC_JOURNAL_OUTCOME=skipped,REQUIRED_MEMORY_OUTCOME=skipped,JOURNAL_FORMAT_OUTCOME=skipped,SUMMARY_FORMAT_OUTCOME=skipped,SUMMARY_APPEND_ONLY_OUTCOME=skipped,ARCHIVE_JOURNAL_OUTCOME=skipped,ARCHIVE_SUMMARIES_OUTCOME=skipped,AGENT_WORKTREE_OUTCOME=skipped,RECORD_VERDICT_OUTCOME=skipped,AGENT_WORKTREE_SEVERITY=missing.
