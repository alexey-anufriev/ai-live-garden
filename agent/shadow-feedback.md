# Autonomous Experiment Verdict

This verdict evaluates the safe code committed by the previous autonomous run. Shadow evaluation is evidence for the next iteration, not a merge gate. The next agent must inspect the current implementation and explicitly choose to keep, revise, or revert it.

- Classification: `inert`
- Acceptance: `experiment`
- PM direction: `A`
- Metric: `population.BEETLE`
- Goal: `increase`
- Required delta: 1
- Observed delta: 0
- Baseline average: 547
- Candidate average: 547
- Safety passed: true
- Target passed: false

## Implemented Hypothesis

Predation inhibition threshold.

## Harness Conclusion

The code was safe but produced zero measured effect. Inspect the committed implementation, identify the inactive gate or clamp, and revise or revert it in the next run; do not add another disconnected mechanism.

## Required Next Decision

Set `causalReach.previousFeedbackDecision` to `reuse`, `revise`, or `abandon` and explain the decision with current-state evidence. Because this code is already on main, inspect and change the implementation directly; there is no rejected branch to recover.
